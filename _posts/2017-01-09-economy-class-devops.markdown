We wanted the benefits of servers spun up in minutes but keeping the costs low.

### Introduction

Readying a server for use is the act of provisioning it. Provisioning takes time, and we want to speed this up. To do this we are going to:

* Our limitations
* Choose a tool

### Our Limitations

We are on a limited budget and we are maintaining a small business network with less than 20 servers. 

### Choose a tool

A first try at speeding up provisioning is configuring servers the same. While quick, diverse demands on the server will lead to compromise over what is installed and how it is configured.

If you can no longer compromise on shared settings, then a second try is to use configuration management tools such asÂ [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/) and [Puppet](https://puppet.com/). These offer speed and flexibility but take longer to program.  

When I made my original choice Chef and Puppet were the most well known. While recent trends have shown that [Ansible has caught up with Chef in terms of popularity - and should be evaluated as well if you were starting today](http://rails-hosting.com/2016/?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email). However, at the time we chose Chef.

Chef has many [paid options](https://www.chef.io/pricing/) but thankfully, some free options. Of those the recommended way to run Chef is on [Chef Server](https://docs.chef.io/server_components.html) but we also tried out [knife-solo](https://matschaffer.github.io/knife-solo/). 

We found that Chef-Server and Knife-solo could do what we wanted but that Knife-solo didn't require additional knowledge to setup and run.

* [Server Provisioning with Chef and Knife-Solo](https://jenssegers.com/55/server-provisioning-with-chef-and-knife-solo). 
* [Configuration management and the golden image](http://russell.ballestrini.net/configuration-management-and-the-golden-image/)

### Cookbook Patterns
Chef is a young framework having been [released in 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef_(software)). At the time we began developing it was a common to forking everything and build on top - we were trying to avoid that and found the following patterns interesting:

* [The Environment Cookbook Pattern by Jamie Winsor - covers all the cookbook patterns](http://blog.vialstudios.com/the-environment-cookbook-pattern/)
* [Suggested Environment Cookbook folder Structure - ifeltsweet](https://github.com/berkshelf/berkshelf/issues/535) - the whole thread is worth reading. 
* Wrapper Cookbook - 


### Provision Architecture

#### Environments Cookbook 
The book that orchestrates the configuration of the servers in the environment. Each environment, say production and staging, should have its own cookbook.

The cookbook is complex because an environment can cover a number of servers, say application, database and proxy servers.

We used solo instances where the server splits the role of an application and a database server. [While not recommended](https://blog.engineyard.com/2013/database-memory), on a low traffic website it was stable and cheaper.

Finally, by having a simple set up we could flatten the environments into one cookbook cutting cookbook maintenance.
